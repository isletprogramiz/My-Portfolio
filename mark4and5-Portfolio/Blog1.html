    <h1>  My Nimcet Journey  </h1>
    <p>
        Hello guys! My name is Shilpi and i welcome you all to my very first blog. The best part about this blog is that,
        it is released on a Blog page  which is created by me.
        In this blog you all are going to read about my nimcet journey , how i studied , what my state of mind by then was, which book i followed
        and what is this Nimcet exam actually is.
        <p>
            So Nimcet exam is basically an entrance through which a student can get into any Nit college for their masters in computer applications.
            It consists of 4 sections - Maths, Reasoning, English and Computer Awareness. Maths here is the deciding key . Alone consisting 60% of the paper, if you excel maths you can easily crack this xam.
            Sad part about this exam is very less people are aware of this exam as in 2021 only 11k approx students only appeared for the exam.
        </p>
        <p> I heard about this exam in my first year of BCA though one of my well-wisher, but i didn't take it so seriously till my 3rd year of BCA.
            Actually i was not at all in a mood to give this exam , i was thinking to move to another field. But again this wave of nimcet exam , nit college starts 
            circulating in my class, half of my classmates were preparing for it. Then i talked to two of my friends. i would love to mention their name here 
            One is Ayush Anand and other is Vishal Gaurav. Ayush Anand is really such a sweet boy you barely can find a boy like him, among we three friends me vishal and ayush, Ayush is our motivational guru.

          <h4>My Strategy</h4>
          I started my preparation from jan end that time I had 4 months for the paper as exam took place in mid may.
          In starting i was following unacademy for maths, but as time passes i realised studying from unacademy wasn't helping me in my prep, I couldn't able to crack questions 
          So after 1 month studying from unacademy I move on to Amit Sir, I stick to that teacher for concept revision
          and start solving R D Sharma theory book which i used to solve  in my 12th, for question practice.
          For reasoning i didnt go for any book. I solved PYQ's for it. 
          For computer I watched videos of Pratik Sir which is free available on Youtube.
          For english I didnt do anything. <br>
          When Talk abt time, i didn't watch time my instict tells me how much i have to study, when i feel 'aur hna chahiye',i keep studying and when i feel 'ye ho jayega', i don't feel to study for a minute.
          So there is no time boundation, u see your current status and how much you need to reach to desired destination, study according to that but consistency is must.
          <h4>Difficulties</h4>
          I don't call it difficulty but 'AISH' when corona hits, my exam got postphoned and there was no notice when the next date of exam is.  Like most students i also lost my consistency.
          More than a month I haven't touched my books, my insticts were constantly says 'Aishe nhi ho paayega '. After 1 one month i again come in form and for last 2 months i studied with same seriousnesss as in starting and able to crack this exam. Yaay :D
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>More i was lucky too in this exam may be because of my mother blessings</p>
        <p>Also got to know what cracking of exams means for a parent . So give exam , crack that exam and give your parents happiness. :)</p>
